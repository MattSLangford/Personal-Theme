# Tiny Theme (Simplified)

A simplified, fast-loading plain text theme for mattlangford.com.

## Description
This is a simplified version of the original Tiny Theme, optimized for speed and plain text styling. All microhooks have been removed, dark mode has been disabled, and the design focuses on fast loading and clean typography. It's designed specifically for mattlangford.com with a left-aligned, responsive layout that works without media queries.
